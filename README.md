## Serial Comms with Windows API


</div>

### Description

When I started with Serial Comms and the API's I tried to find a piece of code as an example... I couldn't , so I wrote my own .. and here it is. Any suggestions to better the code will be great. This little program will open a COM port and read from it as well as write to it. Try this on any serial comm's device like a Modem, barcode scanner, Comm Printer etc.
